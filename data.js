Everyone but the drummer danced throughout the set and they had colorful costumes, which the littler one was drawn to`,

She Past Away came up, and while their set was enjoyable, a group of girls in their early 20's came up to the front and were really pushy. It was surprising to me, because back in NY, there's show etiquette, and normally people don't shove so much at goth, post-punk or darkwave types of shows. This was different. This group of drunk girls were trying to shove their way through everyone in the front. They almost got into a fight with some of the women and couples who had been there before them. The people they tried to push through were generally older, around my age range, from what I can tell.</p>
        
        <p class="content-text">There were also a few guys on the other side who were trying to start a mosh pit. I'm not against that, but it doesn't fit this type of music. Post-punk isn't aggressive enough for it, and I heard three of the guys who were trying to start a circle pit talk about going to death metal shows, so they know the difference.</p>`,

The second day would have had Nitzer Ebb, who I really wanted to see, The Revolting Corpse, High Functioning Flesh, Rein and Spike Hellis. Nitzer Ebb is one of the originators of this style of electronica / industrial / electronic body music.<p>

        <p class="content-text">I can't stress enough how much I love the ambiance of The Mayan. The architecture, the digital backdrop, the setup and layout of the bars (they're so conveniently located). You can fall back away from the lower floor by the stage behind a higher floor with standing tables which make it easy to see and enjoy a show while drinking - Sue and I spent the majority of the show in that area, within reach of a multitude of bars and bathrooms. I love this place.</p>

        <p class="content-text">I was messaging with Ed from Disgorge about this venue and I mentioned to him that it has the coolest look out of any venue I've been to in LA. The bathrooms didn't follow the theme though. It's a missed opportunity - we could be taking a whizz into a sacrificial altar while the jaguar god looks down menacingly at our junk - but instead, there are normal urinals. üêÜ</p>`,

It was amazing to see him play live. Interloper completely blew me away. They have two guitarists and a drummer, but no bassist. They play 8-string guitars though and still fill in the low end. Their set was technical and heavy. I need to see them again.</p>`,
