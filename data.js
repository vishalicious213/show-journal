They're billed as "A traveling and virtual dark art market for the weird, wild, occult and obscure." There was a lot of cool art and craftwork. I'm used to seeing paintings, sculptures, clothing and illustrations at art shows, but adding masks and an eclectic mix of knicknacks and weaponry made it really fun.`,

At some point during the show, she needed to step away and asked Sue to keep her place, which she did. Towards the end of the show, they exchanged numbers. A few months later, they hit some shows together. Later, I met them for eats in Koreatown. After that, we all started going to shows together.</p>
        <p class="content-text">As an aside, Killian Duarte is playing bass for Fallujah now. I used to share his videos on my old bass blog, sometime in the early 2010's. It was amazing to see him play live. Interloper completely blew me away. They have two guitarists and a drummer, but no bassist. They play 8-string guitars though and still fill in the low end. Their set was technical and heavy. I need to see them again.</p>`,

            <p class="content-text">The lines outside of Hollywood Palladium were long, but moved quickly. I didn't get any shots of Arch Enemy. Their crowd was unbelievable. We were packed like sardines and I couldn't get my arms up to take any clean shots, plus I was trying to keep Sue from getting crushed by the weight of the horde.</p>

            <p class="content-text">It was both of our first times seeing Unto Others, the openers. We were really impressed with them. I ended up getting their latest album, "Strength". They're like a heavier version of Sisters of Mercy, with one foot in Iron Maiden and one in gothic rock.</p>
