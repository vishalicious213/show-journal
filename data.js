            <p class="content-text">The lines outside of Hollywood Palladium were long, but moved quickly. I didn't get any shots of Arch Enemy. Their crowd was unbelievable. We were packed like sardines and I couldn't get my arms up to take any clean shots, plus I was trying to keep Sue from getting crushed by the weight of the horde.</p>

            <p class="content-text">It was both of our first times seeing Unto Others, the openers. We were really impressed with them. I ended up getting their latest album, "Strength". They're like a heavier version of Sisters of Mercy, with one foot in Iron Maiden and one in gothic rock.</p>
